# Relationship

In this module we learn to approach properly relationships in the OOP paradigm.

## Composition

Composition is mainly a mechanism that allows an instance or object of a class to contain instance of the same or other classes.
This allow us to create complex objects from simpler objects.

This concept could make us think of inheritance, but these are two different concepts in OOP. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/composition-vs-inheritance
